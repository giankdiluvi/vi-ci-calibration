# Code

This directory contains all the code developed for the project.

## Directory roadmap
- `cauchy.ipynb` contains the Cauchy example from Section 3.1
- `logistic_regression.ipynb` contains the logistic regression
 example from Section 3.2
- `vi.py` contains `python` code to optimize Gaussian variational approximations

## How to run

You can visualize the code and results on GitHub by opening either `ipynb` file.
This saves you from running any code.

If you want to run the code,
you might need to install certain dependencies (like `pyStan`).
Once you do this, you should be able to download the `ipynb` files
and run them locally.
